# University-Projects

This is a repository containing some University Projects i made throughout the years.

TwitterCounter:
    The problem i was asked to solve is that given two twitter accounts, we wanted to find out which account had the most words in its recent    
    tweets. I used the twitter API via the Tweepy module to solve this problem.
    
CreditCards:
    The problem was that given a credit card number (16 digits), i had to use the Luhn algorithm to check if its real or not. I added more
    functionality to this program by checking also if the type of card is correct, using the BIN number of each card type, and not fixing the
    number length to 16, but to each card types respective number length. I also give the option to the user to check only if the card number
    is valid, or if he wants to check if both the type and number is valid.
    
ReverseWords:
    The problem was given a text file, we want the program to find the five biggest words in the file, reverse the words and then remove all
    the vowels before printing the words out. I added more functionality to the program by giving the user the choice to count or not count the
    symbols, as well as choose if they will be printed out or not.
    
ListNumbers:
    The problem was given a 6-digit number, to find if there are any 4-digit numbers in a file that are subset of the 6-digit number. I added
    more functionality to the program by letting the user choose whether he wants only subsets of the 6-digit number, or if he just wants to
    find all the 4-digit numbers that have all their digits present in the 6-digit number.
    
NumberProcessor:
    The problem was given a number, multiply it by 3, add 1 and then add all its digits. If the result is not a 1-digit number, do the same
    process again until it does.
